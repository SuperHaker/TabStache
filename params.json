  "body": "### What is TabStache?\r\nTabStache is a chrome extension that optimizes bookmark all functionality for context switching.  \r\n\r\n### Why use TabStache?\r\nYou have multiple tabs open doing research on your next big project. A new inspiration strikes: your next big thing, a vacation destination, or maybe your kid would like some pony coloring pages. Don't mix your research with coloring pages. TabStache allows you to stash your current tabs for you to work on a new task. Then, when you are ready to continue, restore your progress.\r\n\r\n### How did TabStache come to be?\r\nTabbed browsing is the sliced bread of the internet. I started off as a close-no-tabber, living with favicon-only tabs all the way across the top of the window. Eventually, this turned into layers upon layers of windows containing groups of tabs. This turned into trying to stagger windows to expose a corner to click on. Staggering windows to make the content in them easier to find is a process smell in organizing ideas.\r\n\r\n### How does TabStache work?\r\nAfter installing the chrome extension, click on TabStache and enter a name for your stash. TabStache will bookmark all your open tabs and close them. You are now ready for the next thing. TabStache uses bookmarks so they are will sync and are still available even without TabStache.\r\n\r\n### Make TabStache great\r\nHaving trouble with TabStache? Have an idea on how to make TabStache even more awesome? Submit an issue [here](https://github.com/dngrhm/TabStache/issues).\r\n",
